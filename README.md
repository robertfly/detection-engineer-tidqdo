## üöÄ Deployment

### Cloud Infrastructure

The platform is optimized for AWS deployment with the following services:
- EKS for container orchestration
- RDS for relational databases
- DocumentDB for detection storage
- ElastiCache for performance optimization
- S3 for object storage

### Deployment Process

1. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

2. Deploy infrastructure:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

3. Deploy application:
```bash
make deploy-prod
```

## üìä Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring is implemented using DataDog:
- Application performance metrics
- Custom business metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- User behavior analytics

## üîí Security

Security is implemented at multiple layers:
- TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Regular security scanning and updates

For security-related concerns, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).
