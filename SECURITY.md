## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive security policy for the AI-Driven Detection Engineering platform. It provides detailed information about our security practices, standards, and procedures for vulnerability reporting. Our commitment to security is fundamental to protecting our users' data and maintaining the integrity of our detection engineering ecosystem.

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers and the community to maintain the highest security standards. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Channels

- Primary Email: security@company.com
- Bug Bounty Platform: https://company.com/security/bounty
- Security Portal: Available for enterprise customers

### Response Timeline

- Initial Response: Within 24 hours
- Status Update: Every 48-72 hours
- Resolution Target: Based on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 72 hours
  - Medium: 1 week
  - Low: 2 weeks

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a 90-day coordinated disclosure policy:
1. Initial report received and acknowledged
2. Investigation and validation period
3. Resolution development and testing
4. Coordinated public disclosure after 90 days or when a patch is available

## Authentication Methods

### Username/Password Authentication
- Algorithm: Argon2id
- Configuration:
  - Memory Cost: 64MB
  - Iterations: 3
  - Parallelism: 4
- Password Requirements:
  - Minimum Length: 12 characters
  - Complexity: Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
  - History: Previous 24 passwords cannot be reused

### OAuth 2.0 Integration
- Provider: Auth0
- Supported Flows:
  - Authorization Code Flow
  - Client Credentials Flow
- Required Scopes:
  - openid
  - profile
  - email
- Security Features:
  - PKCE Required
  - State Parameter Validation
  - Strict Redirect URI Validation

### API Key Authentication
- Signing Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
- Key Properties:
  - Length: 32 bytes
  - Format: Base64URL-encoded
  - Rotation: Mandatory 90-day rotation
- Distribution:
  - Secure Portal Only
  - TLS 1.3 Required
  - One-time Viewing

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Primary Method: TOTP (RFC 6238)
- Backup Methods:
  - Recovery Codes (One-time use)
  - Security Keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Enforcement:
  - Required for all users
  - No opt-out option
  - Grace period: None

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key Management:
  - Service: AWS KMS
  - Rotation Period: 365 days
  - Backup: Geographic redundancy
- Implementation:
  - Database-level encryption
  - File-level encryption
  - Volume encryption

### Encryption in Transit
- Protocol: TLS 1.3
- Cipher Suites:
  - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- Features:
  - Perfect Forward Secrecy
  - HSTS Enabled
  - Certificate Pinning

### Data Classification

| Level | Examples | Security Controls |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Public | Community detections | Basic encryption |
| Internal | Enterprise detections | Access controls + Encryption |
| Confidential | User data, credentials | Full encryption + Audit logging |
| Restricted | Keys, secrets | HSM + Enhanced monitoring |
